## 📖 Usage Guidelines

### For Learners
1. **Start with README**: Each project has detailed documentation
2. **Check difficulty level**: Look for badges indicating complexity
3. **Follow along**: Code is meant to be run and modified
4. **Experiment**: Try variations and extensions

### For Workshop Facilitators
1. **Review instructor notes**: Found in `workshops/[topic]/instructor-notes.md`
2. **Test beforehand**: Verify all demos work in your environment
3. **Prepare materials**: Print handouts if needed
4. **Time estimates**: Each workshop includes suggested duration

### For Contributors
1. **Follow structure**: Use existing patterns for consistency
2. **Document thoroughly**: Include clear READMEs and comments
3. **Test your code**: Ensure examples work as documented
4. **Add resources**: Include helpful links and references
